isly-pinterest
==============

Creates JS-driven rollovers for images on a Wordpress blog.  Pins to the permalink instead of the main page. Should be stupid easy to install.

Don't forget to compile the isly-pinterest.coffee file in the scripts directory.  The markup looks for scripts/isly-pinterest.js.
